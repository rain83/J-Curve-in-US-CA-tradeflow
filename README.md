# [The J-Curve Phenomenon in US-Canada Trade Flow]

## Overview:
This project is an visual and empirical validation of the renowned **J-Curve Phenomenon**. Here, the pair of countries under consideration is **United States and Canada**. The hypothesis suggests that following a currency depreciation, a country's trade balance initially worsens before improving over time.

## Methodology:
The study employs **time-series econometric analysis** to evaluate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on trade balance.

### Key steps:
1. **Data Collection**
   - Trade balance data for US-Canada trade.
   - Exchange rate fluctuations.
2. **Statistical Tests**
   - **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:** Checks stationarity.
   - **KPSS Test:** Identifies trend stationarity.
   - **ACF PACF** plots to understand state of stationarity in the data at a glance
3. **Modeling & Analysis**
   - Impulse response function (IRF) to analyze short-run and long-run effects.
   - Visualization of trade balance dynamics over time.

## Limitations:
- Relies on historical data, which may not fully capture future policy shifts.
- The model assumes linear relationships, which may not always hold in real-world trade scenarios.

## Suggestions for improvements:
- Incorporating **additional macroeconomic variables** (inflation, interest rates, etc.) without overfitting.
- Conducting more robust tests for cointegration.
- Testing with **non-linear models** to capture complex trade dynamics.
